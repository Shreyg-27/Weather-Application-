*Working of the application*

This weather website project relies on OpenWeatherMap's API, which provides real-time weather data for any location worldwide. By integrating this API into our project, we are able to provide users with up-to-date weather information, including temperature, weather conditions, and more, for any city they select. This API ensures that our website provides reliable and accurate weather data for users who need to check the weather before planning their activities.
